Dr. Chunjiang Zhu will join the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) in Janurary 2021. He is currently a postdoctor fellow at the <a href="https://healthinfo.lab.uconn.edu">Laboratory of Machine Learning & Health Informatics</a> led by <a href="https://jinbo-bi.uconn.edu">Prof. Jinbo Bi</a>, Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the University of Connecticut starting from April 2018. Before that, he was a postdoctor at the City University of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Baptist University for a few months, and also worked in the Hong Kong based Wisers AI Lab as a researcher and then a senior researcher. Dr. Zhu received his PhD in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong in 2015. His Erd√∂s number is 4. [<a href="chunjiangzhu.github.io/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf">CV</a>]
